# very-cool-waterfall
 A tool for seeing a bunch of words with the same width. Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://kylewaynebenson.github.io/very-cool-waterfall/).

 Code was hard lifted from [Mass Driver](https://mass-driver.com/workshop/) and then modified to add local font loading and set width by word.
